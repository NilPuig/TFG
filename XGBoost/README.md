 A Short Description About the project

 Machine Learning Algorithm used: XGBOOST
 Trained Model                  : model.dat
 Training source code 			: starsvsgalaxy.py
 Testing source code 			: testing.py


 #Class Labels:
 star : 0
 galaxy : 1


 # Python Libraries Required
 1. sklearn
 2. xgboost
 3. pandas

 All of the above libraries can be used installed with the help of pip .

 # In the testing source code I have hard coded the testing file as cat_star_04.csv which should be changed. The on running the testing code a file would be generated depicting the IDs and the predicted class labels.
